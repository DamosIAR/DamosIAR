Nice to meet you! I'm currently studying Game Application and Technology at Bina Nusantara University. I have created several games during my studies as a game programmer, both as part of project assignments and in my spare time. Glowing Pong, Hopeless, and Flappy Bird Clone are some of the games that i have created.
You can check my games on Itch.IO.
